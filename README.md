Hey, welcome to my new portfolio! Here you'll firstly find a diverse array of Python projects showcasing my progression from foundational functions to intricate code structures. 
These projects stem from rigorous studying on several Udemy courses, where I've only now have built up the confidence to start posting my work on here. 
These projects aren't just copied and pasted, I have heavily influenced them with my own personal touch to deliver a bespoke user experience. Hoping to share my passion towards the industry.
As I get better I will share more diverse and personal projects from all sorts of programming lanuages with Libraries and Frameworks added to them!
