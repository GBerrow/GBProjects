In this setup, main.py is responsible for serving the Flask application and defining the routes. 
When a user accesses the homepage ('/'), Flask renders the index.html template and passes a random phrase and the current date & time to be displayed in the HTML. 
The HTML file (index.html) contains the structure and styling of the page, including CSS styles embedded within the <style> tag.
