Fun mini project I have made in my spare time after work!
This Python code creates a simple guessing game using the Turtle graphics library. 
It imports the necessary modules, reads a CSV file containing U.S. state data, and loads an image of the U.S. map. 
The game prompts the user to guess state names one by one until they either guess all states or enter "Exit". 
When the user guesses a correct state, the program marks it on the map using Turtle graphics. 
If the user exits early, the program saves a list of states the user didn't guess into a CSV file for further learning.
